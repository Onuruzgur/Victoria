In this project, an attempt was made to imitate the Amazon Alexa product.

The project has a login and registration page. Login and registration page works with the database created with the Sqlite3 library.

Since a server is not installed, the database is available online. For this reason, login and registration processes are performed offline.

### Main Libraries
  - PyQt5
  - Pyttsx3
  - Pywhatkit
  - Speech-Recognition
  - Sqlite3
 
 ### Commands
  - **'play'**: Opens song on youtube
  - **'what is today's date'**
  - **'what time is it'**
  - **'Make a joke'**
  - **'Send Message'**: Sends the message you want from Whatsapp to the number you want.
  - **'Shut down PC' or 'Cancel Shut Down'** : It shuts down the computer or cancels the shutdown order at the end of the time you want.
  - **'Thanks'**
